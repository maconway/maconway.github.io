# LLMs and academic NLP

I've been thinking quite a bit about the future (and by "future", I mean "survival") of large general domain academic NLP groups given shifts in the research environment since LLMs have become available.  Given my research area focuses specifically on health technology, I suspect that I am somewhat insulaated, but we are living in interesting times.

Sebastian Ruder (and others) have suggested several papers on this broad theme:

Togelius & Yannakakis. (Mar 2023). Choose Your Weapon: Survival Strategies for Depressed AI Academics

Ignat et al. (May 2023). A PhD Student's Perspective on Research in NLP in the Era of Very Large Language Models

Li et al. (Oct 2023). Defining a New NLP Playground
Saphra et al. (Nov 2023). First Tragedy, then Parse: History Repeats Itself in the New Era of Large Language Models
