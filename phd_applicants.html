          <h3 id="slides">PhD Applicants</h3>
          <p>I'm always interested in talking to potential PhD
            students.&nbsp; However, before contacting me, please make
            sure you take time to read some of my recent publications to
            determine whether our research interests align.&nbsp; I am
            primarily a health researcher interested in digital health
            technologies.&nbsp; I'm involved with a substantial amount
            of health-related NLP work, but also have interests in human
            factors, socio-technical issues, and ethics with respect to
            health technologies.&nbsp; I am less interested, and would
            not be an appropriate primary supervisor for domain-agnostic
            machine learning research.&nbsp; Currently, my research
            interests are largely centred on mental health and substance
            use.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Generally speaking, I tend to value intellectual curiosity
            over technical competence (technical skills can be learnt
            quite quickly; the same cannot be said for intellectual
            curiosity).&nbsp; This means that you do not necessarily
            need to have a strong technical background to work with me
            (although this is somewhat dependent on the project).&nbsp;
            I'm very interested to hear from people with education or
            professional experience in psychology, linguistics,
            cognitive science, philosophy, public health and the social
            sciences.<br>
          </p>
          <p>The first step in applying is reaching out to me with a CV
            and a brief outline of your research interests, including
            how your interests align with my recent research.&nbsp; This
            outline should be around two or three paragraphs.&nbsp;
            Please send this to me via email with the subject header
            "PhD Enquiry [Kangaroo]".&nbsp; The inclusion of the
            animal-related keyword indicates that you have read through
            this webpage.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Please note that I do not typically recruit MPhil (research
            masters) students as --- in my view --- this degree does not
            allow sufficient time to generate really substantive
            research outputs for most people. <br>
